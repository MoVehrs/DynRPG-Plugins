# DynRPG-Plugins

Welcome to **DynRPG-Plugins** - a collection of plugins I'm creating for use in my own RPG Maker 2003 project. These plugins are built using **[DynRPG](https://rpg-maker.cherrytree.at/dynrpg/index.html)**, an unofficial patch and plugin system for RPG Maker 2003 developed by Cherry and PepsiOtaku aka rewrking.

## üöÄ Purpose

This repository is meant to:

- Share useful DynRPG plugins with the community.
- Serve as a public archive of my development work.
- Possibly help others enhance their own RPG Maker 2003 games.

## üì¶ Included Plugins

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Work in progress! This list will grow over time as I add more.

- **[bare_handed](https://github.com/MoVehrs/DynRPG-Plugins/tree/main/bare_handed)**
- **[dynamic_quickpatch](https://github.com/MoVehrs/DynRPG-Plugins/tree/main/dynamic_quickpatch)**
- **[limit_break](https://github.com/MoVehrs/DynRPG-Plugins/tree/main/limit_break)**

## üõ† Requirements

- **RPG Maker 2003 v1.08**
- **DynRPG 0.32** installed on your game project **[Link](https://github.com/rewrking/DynRPG)**
- A basic understanding of how to install and use DynRPG plugins

## üìÅ Installation

1. Download the `.dll` file from the plugins directory or compile the source yourself.
2. Copy it into your RPG Maker 2003 game's DynPlugins folder.
3. Make sure your game is DynRPG-patched (game root should include `DynRPG.ini` and `dynloader.dll`).
4. Adjust the `DynRPG.ini` file to load the desired plugins. 

## üß™ Building From Source

If you‚Äôd like to build the plugins yourself instead of using the precompiled `.dll` files, here's how to set up your environment correctly.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è DynRPG operates at a **very low level**, meaning that using the wrong compiler can cause crashes or undefined behavior. It's important to follow the guidelines carefully.

### üß∞ Required Tools

- **C++ Compiler:** DynRPG is built with **GCC**, and only works with **GCC version 4.7.1 or higher**.  
  While Cherry originally recommends GCC directly, I'm using **[TDM-GCC 32-bit](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/)** as a compatible alternative.

- **IDE (Optional):** I recommend using **[Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/)**, a lightweight and easy-to-use C++ IDE that integrates well with TDM-GCC.

### üßµ Steps to Compile

1. Install **[TDM-GCC 32-bit](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/)**.
2. Install **[Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/)** and configure it to use TDM-GCC as the default compiler.
3. Clone this repository and open the `.cbp` project file in Code::Blocks, or create a new project using the source files.
4. Build the project. The resulting `.dll` file will be your DynRPG plugin.

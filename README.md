# DynRPG-Plugins

Welcome to **DynRPG-Plugins** ‚Äì a collection of plugins I'm creating for use in my own RPG Maker 2003 project. These plugins are built using [DynRPG](https://rpg-maker.cherrytree.at/dynrpg/index.html), an unofficial patch and plugin system for RPG Maker 2003 developed by Cherry and PepsiOtaku aka rewrking.

## üöÄ Purpose

This repository is meant to:

- Share useful DynRPG plugins with the community.
- Serve as a public archive of my development work.
- Possibly help others enhance their own RPG Maker 2003 games.

## üì¶ Included Plugins

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Work in progress! This list will grow over time as I add more.

- [dynamic_quickpatch](https://github.com/MoVehrs/DynRPG-Plugins/tree/main/dynamic_quickpatch)
- [limit_break](https://github.com/MoVehrs/DynRPG-Plugins/tree/main/limit_break)

## üõ† Requirements

- **RPG Maker 2003 (v1.08 or later)**
- **DynRPG 0.32** installed on your game project [Link](https://github.com/rewrking/DynRPG)
- A basic understanding of how to install and use DynRPG plugins

## üìÅ Installation

1. Download the `.dll` file from the plugins directory or compile the source yourself.
2. Copy it into your RPG Maker 2003 game's DynPlugins folder.
3. Make sure your game is DynRPG-patched (game root should include `DynRPG.ini` and `dynloader.dll`).
4. Adjust the `DynRPG.ini` file to load the desired plugins.
